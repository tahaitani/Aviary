    "The propulsion subsystem in Aviary organizes and executes models for engine sizing and performance.\n",

    "Aviary does not natively model gas-turbine or electric motor performance, and instead relies on user-provided data and/or custom performance models to perform propulsion analysis.\n",

    "Aviary supports an arbitrary number of propulsor models on a vehicle, each with their own unique properties such as performance characteristics, scaling behaviors, and number of propulsors for that given type. \n",

    "Each unique type of engine is referred to as an engine model<!-- Link to wherever this class is described - theory guide? -->. In Aviary, an engine model contains information on how to size and estimate performance for a single instance of an engine of that type. During analysis, Aviary handles summing performance data to a system level. This way, information is available on the performance of both a single instance of an engine, as well as aircraft-level totals, for other Aviary subsystems to utilize.\n",

A variety of alternate names for these variables are understood by Aviary, but it is recommended to use the official names given here.

Anything after this symbol on that line is ignored by Aviary, allowing the user to temporarily remove data points or add in-line comments with context for the data. It is good practice to include comments at the start of the file to explain what kind of engine the data represents, and where it came from."

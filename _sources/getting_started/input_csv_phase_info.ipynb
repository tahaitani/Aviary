    "  - `required_available_climb_rate`: the minimum rate of climb required from the aircraft at the top of climb (beginning of cruise) point in the mission. You don't want your available rate-of-climb to be 0 in case you need to gain altitude during cruise.\n",
    "  - `EAS_limit`: the maximum descending EAS in knots.\n",
    "  - `throttle_setting`: the prescribed throttle setting. This is only used for `GASP` and `solved` missions.\n",
    "- If a key ends with `_ref` or `_ref0` (except `duration_ref`, `duration_ref0`, `initial_ref` and `initial_ref0`), it is the unit-reference and zero-reference values of the control variable at the nodes. This option is invalid if opt=False. Note that it is a simple usage of  ref and ref0. We refer to [Dymos](https://openmdao.github.io/dymos/api/phase_api.html?highlight=ref0#add-state) for details.\n",
    "- Some keys are for phase time only.\n",

    "- Other Aviary keys:\n",
